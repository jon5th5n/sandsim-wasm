# sandsim-wasm
my c++ falling sand simulation brought to the browser with webassembly

#

After I first struggled a lot with WebAssembly, due to it having very poor actual documentation on what to do after your first "Hello World!" program, I luckily found a guide which helped me a ton with getting my C++ code ready to use with JavaScript.

So I just wanted to share it if there is anybode else out there having struggle with getting into WebAssembly.
